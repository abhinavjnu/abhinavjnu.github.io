## Hello, I'm Abhinav Kumar

**Development Researcher** specializing in digital platforms, platform co-ops, gig work, informal work, and food delivery systems in India.

I am a PhD candidate at the Centre for Informal Sector and Labour Studies, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. My research examines how platform capitalism restructures markets and work, how workers respond through unionization and collective action, and how communities experiment with non-extractive, community-governed digital market systems.

## Academic Background

PhD candidate at the Centre for Informal Sector and Labour Studies, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. I have submitted my doctoral thesis which focused on food delivery platforms, labour process, and resistance in India.

## Research Focus

My research examines digital platforms, gig economy, labour markets, and food delivery systems with a focus on worker conditions and policy implications. I am particularly interested in:

- Political economy of digital platforms and market power
- Labour process, control, and worker resistance in platform-mediated work
- Sustainability of gig and platform-based employment in the Global South
- Community-governed and non-extractive digital market systems
- Informal governance, trust, and solidarity-based digital infrastructures

## Methodology

I am skilled in qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research, survey design, policy analysis, and field-based investigations. My work is grounded in Global South contexts, informed by long-term fieldwork, digital ethnography, and direct engagement with labour unions and worker collectives.
