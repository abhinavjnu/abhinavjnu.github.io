## Welcome

I am a development researcher working on the political economy of digital platforms, with a focus on platform labour, worker resistance, and emerging alternatives to platform monopolies in India.

My work is grounded in Global South contexts, informed by long-term fieldwork, digital ethnography, and direct engagement with labour unions and worker collectives.

### Research Interests

- Political economy of digital platforms and market power
- Labour process, control, and worker resistance in platform-mediated work
- Sustainability of gig and platform-based employment in the Global South
- Community-governed and non-extractive digital market systems
- Informal governance, trust, and solidarity-based digital infrastructures
